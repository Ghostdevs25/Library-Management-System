1.Introduction

This project is a console-based Library Management System implemented in Python. The system allows the administrator to manage books, members, and book issuing/returning processes.
Through this project, we learned modular programming, file handling, and system design.

2. Problem Statement

Traditional library management using manual registers or Excel sheets is time-consuming, error-prone, and not scalable. There is a need for a lightweight, simple digital solution to efficiently manage book inventory and borrowing records.

3. Objectives

To create a functional and efficient library management system

To automate book storage and issuing process

To maintain member details and borrowing history

To practice Python file handling and modular development

4. Functional Requirements

✔ Add new books
✔ View and search books
✔ Register new library members
✔ Issue books
✔ Return books
✔ Display issued book records

5. Non-Functional Requirements

✔ Usability — Simple and easy to operate
✔ Reliability — Data stored in persistent files
✔ Maintainability — Modular code
✔ Performance — Fast execution even with large data
✔ Scalability — Can be extended to DB or GUI

7. Implementation Details

Programming Language: Python
Storage: File-based (.txt files)
Modules:

main.py — main menu & navigation

book.py — add/search/display books

member.py — register/display members

issue_return.py — issue & return system

storage.py — data saving/loading (file handling)

data/books.txt — book database

data/members.txt — member database

data/issued.txt — issued book database

8. Testing Approach
Test Case	Input	Expected Output	Result
Add Book	ID=101	Book added	PASS
Add Member	ID=501	Member added	PASS
Issue Book	Book=101, Member=501	Issued successfully	PASS
Return Book	Book=101	Book returned	PASS
Search Book	Title=“Atomic”	Matches displayed	PASS

9. Challenges Faced

Handling string formatting in .txt files

Avoiding duplicate IDs

Case-sensitive file naming (data vs Data)

Modularizing code into multiple files

10o. Learnings

Python file I/O

Data persistence

Designing maintainable code

Working with multiple modules

Using GitHub for version control

Professional project documentation

11. Future Enhancements

Graphical User Interface (Tkinter / Web UI)

Database implementation using MySQL or SQLite

User authentication (admin / staff)

Advanced reporting & analytics

12. Conclusion

The Library Management System successfully fulfills the intended purpose of maintaining and automating library operations. This project demonstrates Python programming skills, systematic design, documentation, and real-world application development.
